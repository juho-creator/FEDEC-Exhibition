### How it all started
In the introductory engineering class, each group were given with an assignment to come up with a creative invention. My teammamtes had no coding experience so they had no idea what they were doing. Being a Freshmen, my teammates wanted to live their "ideal college life", drinking with people and weren't willing to devote alot time to the project. I was the only one in our team who was willing to pour out all the time and energy into our project. So it was a pretty rough start.


I was a newbie coder, so I was lost too.
I didn't know how I could learn about Arduino programming, mobile programming, and circuit design all by myself. Everything seemed impossible to me.


I tried to break every problem I could see into smaller tasks that could be paid on a daily basis and solve them one by one. I self-taught Arduino, circular design, and mobile app programming with daily planning layouts. Subsequent discussions and delays in implementing different types of moments based on the ideas discussed indicate that the result is a chance to win the Creativity Award at the FEDEC exhibition. It is unfair that it is too daunting to do alone, and because it is a job that I like, I was able to keep doing it even if it was low. After the FEDEC exhibition, I got closer and closer to programming, so I decided to transfer in the second semester
